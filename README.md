This repo contains the following files and folders.

run_analysis.R 
-The following r script refines the UCI HAR Data set by mergeing the training and the test sets to create one data set and extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Also the script labels the data set with descriptive variable names provided in the UCI HAR Data folder. Finally the scpript then creates a second tidy data set with the averages of all the activity variables

CodeBook.md
This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean the data
